Course Description:
======

Electromagnetism C is a course on the electromagnetic phenomena and the electromagnetic interaction. It involves the time-independent and time-dependent properties of electric and magnetic fields in vacuum, conductor and media. The main contents include electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic forces, electromagnetic properties of the conductor and media, electromagnetic induction, DC and AC circuits, as well as a brief introduction to Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic wave. In addition, this course also introduces applications of electromagnetic science and technology in the information and computer science.
