## Course Description:

This course takes C language as the carrier and aims to cultivate the ability of computational thinking and programming capability. Through rich and practical examples, how to analyze problems, organize data and solve problems in the process of programming is shown. It expounds the specific programming process that connects algorithm and coding in the process of computing application, as well as the ideas and methods of structured and modular programming. The main contents of the course include computer foundation, concepts and examples of common grammar elements, basic grammar and structured programming, modular programming and common algorithms and library functions, specific elements and application examples of C language, in-depth thinking of programming and computing, and appendix.
